### Tips

While you're developing your project, you can change your simulator's or device's appearance by using the following shortcuts:

- If working with an iOS emulator locally, you can use the Cmd ⌘ + Shift + a shortcut to toggle between light and dark modes.
- If using an Android Emulator, you can run adb shell "cmd uimode night yes" to enable dark mode, and adb shell "cmd uimode night no" to disable dark mode.
- If using a real device or an Android Emulator, you can toggle the system dark mode setting in the device's settings.
